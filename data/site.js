I’m Tyler, a Sound Designer for video games living in the central US.</p><p>I started learning piano at six, eventually moving into percussion in the early years of school. My musical carrier continued through high school and eventually into college, where I graduated with a Bachelor’s in Music Education from the University of Central Oklahoma. Wanting to delve deeper into the world of game audio, I decided to continue with an MFA in Game Music and Audio from Thinkspace Education which will finish Jan. 2021.</p><p>Meanwhile, I’ve grown a wealth of technical knowledge in my roles as a sysadmin and web developer, configuring/maintaining various systems and developing internal applications for company use.</p>",
